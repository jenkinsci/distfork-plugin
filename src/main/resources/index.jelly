  Turns a Jenkins cluster into a general purpose batch job execution environment through an SSH-like CLI.
  This plugin adds a new command 'distfork' to Jenkins CLI, which can be used to execute arbitrary command
  on a agent of your choice. The distfork command is modelled after ssh, but it's Jenkins aware; for example,
  instead of hardcoding a machine name, you can specify a label to let Jenkins choose a agent.
  This opens up a Jenkins cluster for doing all kinds of things without requiring a job/build notion.
